# Concert-ticket-application

| Small and very much broken application for managing tickets for concerts. Made in plain PHP during Ã¼K-307 in summer 2022. Documentation is found in the [/doc](/doc) folder and the database in [/db](/db).<br>A small framework was provided, but everything in [/app](/app) is our work. <br>Made by [Demian Flury](https://github.com/DemianFlury) and [Simon Hodel](https://github.com/Simon-Hodel) | <img src="https://www.php.net/images/logos/php-logo-white.svg" alt="PHP Logo" width="400px"> |
